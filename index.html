            Amazon Fresh is a new grocery store designed from the ground up to offer <br>
            a seamless grocery shopping experience, whether customers are shopping 
            in store or online. We've taken our decades of operations experience to 
            deliver consistently low prices for all and same-day delivery for Prime members.

        <p style="background-color:azure; color:aqua; font-size:100%">
            What's unique about Amazon Go is the Just Walk Out technology. 
            Customers use their Amazon app, a credit card, or Amazon One to open a gate to enter the store. <br>
            They shop for what they need and then simply leave the store through the designated exit gate. 
            Customers are charged for what they take from the shop.
        </p>

        <p style="background-color:blueviolet; color:blanchedalmond; font-size:100%">
            Amazon Fresh stores offer everything you'd want from a grocery convenience store, 
            including a variety of food from everyday essentials such as seasonal fruit and vegetables 
            and responsibly sourced British fresh meat, to freshly prepared sandwiches and meals, 
            freshly baked bread and hot food served daily.
